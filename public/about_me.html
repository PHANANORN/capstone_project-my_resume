    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! I’m a passionate Web Developer with a knack for creating seamless and dynamic user experiences. With a background in supporting partners and a keen interest in the latest tech trends, I bring a unique perspective to the digital landscape.

        <br>My journey in web development began with a curiosity for how websites function behind the scenes. This curiosity evolved into a skill set that spans various aspects of web development, from front-end design to back-end logic. I’m proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and have experience working with frameworks like React and Angular. <br>
        
        Problem-solving is at the heart of what I do. <br> Whether it’s debugging a tricky piece of code or optimizing website performance, I thrive on tackling challenges head-on. My goal is to deliver websites that not only look great but also perform exceptionally well.
        
        When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring the latest advancements in computer hardware and networking, which helps me stay ahead of the curve and bring innovative solutions to my work.
        
        Let’s connect and create something amazing together.
